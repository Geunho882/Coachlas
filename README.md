-Any known issues or limitations
Ai was used for help for database part since it was difficult to code and running out of time.
The chat feature was very difficult to create and only the text written is sent to database not answers, etc.
Cards were also difficult to code, so the spacing for text are off.
 'key cues' part was meant to have a drop down animation but had trouble coding it so its just there.

-Any other Instructions
If lost, 
flow one: click on the magnifying glass icon > click on exercises text > click on squats
flow two: click on chat bubble icon > click on 'want to create a new split?' > type something and click the send icon(bottom right side)
